# plans/ -- Plan File Conventions

**Plans go in `plans/`.** Do not create plan files in any other location.

**Plan file naming**: Use `UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES.md` (e.g., `OPTIMIZATION_PLAN.md`).

## R7RS Investigation Procedure

When investigating R7RS conformance issues:
1. Document each test BEFORE running it in `plans/R7RS_TEST_INVESTIGATION_IN_PROGRESS.md`
2. Save the file, run the test (max 15s timeout), log results, save again
3. Keep error summary at top; use bisection technique to isolate errors

## Plan Files

| File | Contents | Status |
|------|----------|--------|
| `PERFORMANCE.md` | Allocation optimization (completed fixes + remaining tiers), block-allocated pairs (complete), unified pool manager (complete), fused lexing research | Mixed |
| `SECURITY.md` | Extension-level sandboxing model, authorization framework, opcode resource limits | Proposed/Design |
| `MACRO_SYSTEM.md` | ER macro transformer, hygiene debugging design, macro expansion tracing | Proposed/Planned |
| `DEBUGGER.md` | Inline breakpoint traps, snap-to-next breakpoint resolution | Proposed |
| `ARCHITECTURE.md` | Engine refactor (complete), dialect system, module decomposition, plugin shadowing, environment introspection | Mixed |
| `TESTING.md` | Scheme test expansion (complete) | Complete |

## Before Starting Work

**ALWAYS check existing project artifacts before planning or proposing solutions:**

1. **Check `plans/` directory** -- Read relevant plan files to understand existing design decisions, phase status, and what's already been explored
2. **Check `TODO.md`** -- Verify the task isn't already completed or documented as deferred
3. **Check existing patterns** -- Search the codebase for prior art before proposing new designs

**Do not:**
- Create new plan files without reading existing ones in `plans/`
- Propose architectural approaches without checking how similar problems are already solved
- Start implementation without verifying assumptions against actual code
